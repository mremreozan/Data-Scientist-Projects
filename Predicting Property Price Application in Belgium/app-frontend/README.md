## The project's objectives

You work for a housing company called "ImmoEliza". You have been contacted by your company's R & D / AI department because they need your skills.

They just finished creating an API to predict the price of a house. They are really happy with how this app works, but they need it to be used in the case of a web app that the sales team can use.

As you know, they are really crazy about computers and software, we need you to create an application that will bridge the gap between our R&D department and the end user: our sales team.

The application will be quite simple. He only needs two things. First. A shape. The form will be for user two complete with information about the house. This form will be connected to the API. The second thing is how to display the results. We don't really have much to say about it. It could be a pop-up, another page, you have wiggle room there.

## Learning objectives (if it is a learning challenge)

backend: connection to a house API using javascript and fetch (or some other way;)) -> fetch on MDN
frontend: creation of a user-friendly form and a clear results page.

## Indispensable features

A shape
Results display
another page
appear

## Nice to have

deploy your app using a hosting provider that you haven't used before.

## Various information

You will be assigned to an AI referrer. they will not be by your side all the time, but they have been given clear information about dropping everything and coming to answer your questions during those two days! Use their knowledge whenever you feel the issue is API related, not web development :)
