## Predicting Property Price Application in Belgium

In this project at Becode we developed an application to predict property price in Belgium. Data source is Immoweb. We used gradient boosting algorithm to create a model in machine learning. This model give a prediction prices according to property's parameters like area, location, room number etc. This application constitutes of backend and frontend part. Everyone can reach this application on internet thanks to Heroku platform.

## Scin Care Mole Detection Application

This part is developed by data scientist and include data cleaning, analysis and creating model. We used Flask to create application and deployed on Heroku. You can reach all details about this part in App-backend folder.


## Web Scraping Data from Immoweb

This part is developed by web developer and include web interface of this project. Web developer uses the application on heroku developed by data scientist. You can reach all details about this part in App-frontend folder.
